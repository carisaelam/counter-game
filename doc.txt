COUNTER GAME 

IDEAS: 
ability to raise or lower the number [eventually by cards]
goal is to get as close to target number as possible without busting
target number randomly generated (50-100)

TO DO: 
✅ create basic HTML structure
 --increment button
 --display target number
 --display current number
 --reset button

 ✅ figure out why current doesn't always start at 0

 add a scoring feature 
 --button to add to score
 --adds the statusData amount to a running score [somehow]
 --if you bust, you lose x number of points from your total score
 --maybe add a timer as well so there is a finite amount of time to play
